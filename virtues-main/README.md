Spatial proteomics technologies have transformed our understanding of complex tissue architecture in cancer but present unique challenges for computational analysis. Each study uses a different marker panel and protocol, and most methods are tailored to single cohorts, which limits knowledge transfer and robust biomarker discovery. Here we present Virtual Tissues (VirTues), a general-purpose foundation model for spatial proteomics that learns marker-aware, multi-scale representations of proteins, cells, niches and tissues directly from multiplex imaging data. From a single pretrained backbone, VirTues supports marker reconstruction, cell typing and niche annotation, spatial biomarker discovery, and patient stratification, including zero-shot annotation across heterogeneous panels and datasets. In triple-negative breast cancer, VirTues-derived biomarkers predict anti-PD-L1 chemo-immunotherapy response and stratify disease-free survival in an independent cohort, outperforming state-of-the-art biomarkers derived from the same datasets and current clinical stratification schemes.

## Installation
To create a new conda environment `virtues` with Python 3.12 and install all requirements run:
```
source setup.sh
```

## Getting Started

### Configuration
Before running VirTues, please ensure that your base configuration found in `configs/base_config` is properly setup for your system. 
This includes setting the following fields:
```yaml
experiments_dir: <path-to-dir> # path of directory to save all training runs

experiment.name: <run-name> # the name of your training run
experiment.wandb_mode: 'disabled' | 'online' | 'offline' # set to 'disabled' to disable wandb logging
experiment.wandb_entity: <entity-name> # your wandb entity name, leave empty for default
experiment.wandb_project: <project-name> # your project name

datasets_config: <path-to-config> # path to config file describing training datasets

marker_embedding_dir: <path-to-dir> # path of directory containing marker embeddings saved as [UniprotID].pt files
```
Alternatively, you can set these fields from the command line when starting the training.

### Datasets
We provide a simple class `MultiplexDataset` to load datasets of multiplexed images. 
To setup a new dataset for this interface, we recommend following our file structure:
```z
path/to/datasets/folder/
├──[custom]/
│   ├──images/ # multiplexed images without processing, names must match 'tissue_id' column in tissue_index.csv
│   │  ├──[tissue_id].npy
│   │  ├──[tissue_id].npy
│   │  ├──...
│   ├──crops/ # precomputed image crops for training without preprocessing, names must match 'tissue_id' and 'crop_id' column in crop_index.csv
│   │  ├──[tissue_id]_[crop_id].npy
│   │  ├──[tissue_id]_[crop_id].npy
│   │  ├──...
│   ├──masks/ # cell segmentations masks, names must match 'tissue_id' column in tissue_index.csv
│   │  ├──[tissue_id].npy
│   │  ├──[tissue_id].npy
│   │  ├──...
│   ├──tissue_index.csv # tissue-wise annotations, must contain column 'tissue_id' and 'split'
│   ├──crop_index.csv # crop-wise annotations, must contain column 'tissue_id' and 'crop_id'
│   ├──channels.csv # list of markers and corresponding UniprotIDs measured by each channel, order must match images and crops 
│   ├──means.csv # channel-wise means for each tissue used for standardization during preprocessing, index must match 'tissue_id'
│   ├──stds.csv # channel-wise standard deviations for each tissue used for standardization during preprocessing, index must match 'tissue_id'
│   ├──quantiles.csv # channel-wise quantiles for each tissue used for clipping during preprocessing, index must match 'tissue_id'
│   ├──sce_annotations.csv # (not required for training) cell-wise annotations, must contain columns 'tissue_id' and 'cell_id' 
```

After setting up all datasets, you need to configure a .yaml file that specifies the paths to each dataset.
For orientation and demonstration purposes, we provide an example dataset containing a single tissue in `assets/example_dataset`, along with corresponding configuration files located at `configs/datasets/example_config.yaml` and `configs/datasets/example_config_multiple_datasets.yaml`.

Finally, for every measured marker across all datasets, a marker embedding must be precomputed using ESM-2 and stored in `marker_embedding_dir` following the naming convention `[UniprotID].pt`.
To faciliate this step, we provide two utility scritps.\
You can automatically download FASTA files containing the canonical amino acid sequence from Uniprot with the script `utils/download_fastas.py` by specifying a `.csv` file with column `protein_id` containing the Uniprot IDs (including potential isoform suffixes). For this run: 
```
python -m utils.download_fastas --output_dir [PATH] --csv [CSV-FILE]
```
To generate ESM-2 embeddings of these sequences, you can use the script `utils/compute_esm_embeddings.py` via:
```
python -m utils.compute_esm_embeddings --input_dir [PATH1] --output_dir [PATH2] --device [cpu/cuda] --model [MODEL]
```
Resulting embedings will be saved at `[PATH2]/[MODEL]/[UniportID].pt`. The official published weights of VirTues were trained with the ESM-2 model `esm2_t30_150M_UR50D` (set as default). For very long protein sequences, video memory requirements might be high. In this case, we recommend running the script using `--device cpu` and sufficient RAM.

### Training 
After setting up the datasets, VirTues can be pretrained via the `train.py` script. For example, to train an instance of VirTues with a custom dataset config run:
```bash
python -m train experiment.name=[NAME] datasets_config=[PATH]
```

The training script also supports distributed training. For this we recommend using torchrun. For example, to train on a single node with 4 GPUs run:
```bash
torchrun --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=4 -m train experiment.name=[NAME] datasets_config=[PATH]
```

All training results are stored in the `experiments_dir/experiment.name` directory.

### Inference

#### Pretrained Weigths
As an alternative to training a VirTues model from scratch, we also provide pretrained weights via [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/bunnelab/virtues). For instructions, how to download and load these, please refer to the Demo notebooks below.

#### Demos

To help you start using a trained VirTues model for downstream analyses, the `notebooks` folder includes demonstrations of several common use cases:

-  `1_demo_reconstruction.ipynb` – Shows how to use VirTues to reconstruct partially masked channels or inpaint fully masked ones.
- `2_demo_cell_phenotyping.ipynb`  – Demonstrates how to compute cell tokens with VirTues, which can be used for applications such as cell phenotyping and virtual biomarker discovery.
